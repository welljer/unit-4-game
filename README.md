## How to play
This is a guessing game using numbers where the player will guess with numbers.
There will be three tools displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
When the player clicks on a tool it will add a specific amount to the depth travelled to the player's depth.
The player wins the game if their total depth matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total depth goes above the random number.
The amount of points each tool adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each tool is clicked.
The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
If the player successfully matches their total depth to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total depth is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.
